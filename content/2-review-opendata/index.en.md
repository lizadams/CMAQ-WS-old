### CMAS Data Warehouse


CMAS Data Warehouse on AWS collects and disseminates meteorology, emissions and air quality model input and output for Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model Applications. 

https://registry.opendata.aws/cmas-data-warehouse/

This collection of datasets is available as part of the AWS Open Data Program, therefore egress fees are not charged to either the host or the person downloading the data. This S3 bucket is maintained as a public service by the University of North Carolina's CMAS Center, the US EPA’s Office of Research and Development, and the US EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. 

Metadata and DOIs for datasets included in the CMAS Data Warehouse are available from the CMAS Dataverse site: https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataverse/cmascenter
